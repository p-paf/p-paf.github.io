## Style Guide for Haskell (while submitting homeworks)

- Use camelCase (may use id_with_und too for local variables)
- Use descriptive function names (as in other languages)
- Use an IDE that has tabs-to-spaces (like VSCode(the one we use in the class)). Don't use tabs anywhere in the code.
- If you are using VSCode, check out the "Haskell Syntax Highlight" and "Haskelly" extensions.
- Give type signatures to functions.
- Precede functions with comments about what they do. (as in other languages)
- Your functions should be total.
- Prepend "{-# OPTIONS_GHC -Wall #-}" to all your codes to take care of all compile time warnings.
- Read up about Haskell's [warnings](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/using-warnings.html) and error messages and how to use them effectively using GHC flags.
