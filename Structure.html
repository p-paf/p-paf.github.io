            <p style="margin-bottom:2vh;">Check the <a href="../assets/course_handout.pdf">course handout</a> for lecture wise breakup of topics. There is no need to purchase any books/software. All resources will be openly available, check references
                below for some details. Some excerpts, we provide during the course, will be taken from:
                <li>Learn Python 3 The Hard Way by Zed Shaw</li>
                <li>Thinking Functionally with Haskell by Richard S. Bird</li>

                There will be short homeworks after some lectures. You will not be graded on
                them, and you can find them at the end of the respective lecture slides.

                All assignments must be turned in on time. We will allow a total of four late days
                cumulatively. We will not make any additional allowances for late assignments: the late days are
                intended to provide for exceptional circumstances, and students should avoid using them unless
                absolutely necessary. Any assignments that are submitted late (with insufficient late days
                remaining) will not be graded.
